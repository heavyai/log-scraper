# OmniSci Log Scraper - Python functions

The python functions in [omnisci_log_scraper.py](omnisci_log_scraper.py)
are given as example code.
The API of these functions may change without notice.

The functions are to be used with the OmniSciDB `omnisci_log_scraper` table
that is created and loaded by the `omnisci-log-scraper` command line tool.

The code depends on libraries `pandas`, `pymapd`, and `ibis.omniscidb`.
